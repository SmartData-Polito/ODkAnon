This report contains code of **Protecting participants or population? Comparison of
k-anonymous Origin-Destination matrices** for 2025 NetMob data challenge

## Dataset Access

**The NetMob25 Dataset: A High-resolution Multi-layered View of Individual Mobility in Greater Paris Region**
The data is not publicly available. To reproduce our results, you must request access to the dataset from the challenge organizers. 
See the [Data Challenge Website](https://netmob.org/www25/datachallenge) for access instructions and the [dataset documentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05903) for more details.

## Acknowledgments

For our experiments and comparisons, we used algorithms provided in the following papers:


 - **ATG-Soft:** [Adaptative generalisation over a value hierarchy for the k-anonymisation of Originâ€“Destination matrices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X23002255)
 - **Modrian:** [Mondrian Multidimensional K-Anonymity](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1617393)
 - **OIGH:** [Data privacy preservation algorithm with k-anonymity](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11280-021-00922-2)

We gratefully acknowledge the authors of ATG-Soft for sharing codes.

We use the implementation of OIGH from [this repo](https://github.com/Nuclearstar/K-Anonymity)
